The First Princess Day: or How I Learned that Mexican Amatuer Porn Involving  Bicycles is Just Better
===============================================================================

Sitting here, eating a fresh egg-salad[^1] with corn chips and sipping some tequila, I am comforted by the comfortable distance of a few days between the writing of this post, and the
actual events being recorded. I had several visceral physical reactions to my first princess
day outing, and they left me questioning many things[^3].

However, our story begins much earlier where, flush from the triumphant baptism of a new day[^3], I and several other friends decided to inagurate princess day. After considering the listings of events in Boulder, I found one that seemed quirky, original, and obscure enough to mark one as a man who had his finger on the pulse of the city. Perfect date material, even
if the date is oneself. This is how I decided on Bike Smut! A Film Festival dedicated to
exploring the intersection of mobility and sexuality[^4]. This would then be followed by
One Dollar Tacos at Mountain Sun. A one-two combination sure to dazzle anyone! Tacos, then tacos[^5]. 

Plus, as an avowed Star Trek, Star Wars and all around science fiction fan, the added cheery on top was that this year the theme was Science Friction. All this was to turn to ash in my mouth. The eating-tacos at the Mountain Sun were nice though.

The Festival.

First, a disclaimer. Please read the below as one man trying to put you in his, admittadly purityrannical, reaction to these films. My comments are not meant to be body-shaming [^6] in anyway-- I am merely trying to describe the intense reactions that I felt.

1. Mexican Lesbians. They kiss, one goes riding, one starts masterbating. Commentary on the 
solo, fetishized 'movement-for-movement's-sake' philosophy of recreational cycling? Perhaps.

2. Charlie Chaplin. Begins in black and white. Homeless man gifts sex toy to woman. She uses it (offscreen[^7]), and the world becomes fully of vibrant colours.[^8]

3. Hispanic woman masterbates while straddling bicycle in a park. Most 'arty' of the films. I enjoyed this for again a tasteful restraint. By using metaphorical imagery (notably, an engorged red balloon inflating), and accompanied by a dulcimer that dischordantly hammered away, the audience was induced into an anxious, uncomfortable, but aroused state. Presumably the same state that would lead a Mexican to masterbate on a bike in a park. 

4. Shitty 'arty' film--German Neo Expressionism taken so seriously it becomes parody. Derivative.

(Note. At this point, I had begun pulling from a flask that I had secreted on my person, and things start to become a little hazy.)

?. Domestic mystery, detective noir. Bikes are sentient. One enlists the aid of a hardboiled detective to unravel domestic affair. Detective peaks in on couple having sex while standing over a bike. Note: this is the first real 'porn', in the sex scene has no artistic merit and is just two people fucking with bad sound production. And lots of hair.[^10]

?+1. Post-apocolypic. Woman tracks down man, brainwashes him into having sex with her[^11] First close up of a dick and cum-on-titties-shot. Dick has an interesting geometry. Also, I realized that when men walk with hard dicks, it looks as though their dicks are being made to dance al la Pinnocio "I've Got No Strings". Silent, and better for it. 

?+2. Bike sleeps around. Best filmed straight-up porn scene. Good lighting, music was suitable. Also mexican-- no surprise.

?+3. Post-apocolypitc with heavy handed morality segues into weird glitter sex with 'Rubenesque' girl.

?+4. Animated. (Also, no surprise, mexican.) Artistic, fun. Highlight of the festival.

?+5. 'Classic' style porn with two sex scenes. One where a drugged man is anally penetrated with a strapon. Again, I am triggered.

Then, we left, and went to get tacos. And we thought about what just happened.


Closing thoughts.

Somewhere in there was a film that caused a physical reaction from me. Two lesbians, one young, one old, have sex in a bike shop. The older one is hoisted up, so she is suspended in mid-air. A Macgyvered sex-toy in the form of a screwdriver whose shaft had been driven into a drill, and all covered with a condom is brought up to her vagina. Now, something about the combination of a moist, hairy, and meaty[^13] vagina being perturbed by a screwdriver handle moving at 100 rpm made me gag.
Seeing the vagina undulate like the Baron Harkonnen smacking his lips, hearing the tinny whine of the power drill, seeing the light glisten off her labia like roast beef under the buffet heat lamps, and the almost surgical dispassion of the young woman operating the drill, it all combined to produce a sensory experience that was overwhelming to me, and I gagged. Repeatedly. I am still coming to terms with: a) my reaction to that, and b) what that says about me. Have I been so
indocrinated by media and well-produced porn to only find hairless (or tasteful landing stripped), vaginas whose cup does not overflowth with meat, attractive?

Yes. I suppose so.



Fucking patriarchy.



[^1]: Soooo fucking fresh[^2].
[^2]: The small, unintended pleasures of bachelor living.
[^3]: Vaginas? Hair? Naturalness: Is it Beautiful?
[^4]: Also, a refreshing 'sex-positive but also winky innuendo' vibe that would be sure to score points with a woman who belongs in 2015.
[^5]: I'm sorry.
[^6]: Although, where do you drawn the line? No one is telling people with enflamed buttholes to be proud of them. There are no butthole movement on twitter where people post pictures of their buttholes and are congratulated on having a beautiful butthole. But, hairy, meaty vaginas are something to be embraced. I'm sorry.
[^7]: A rare display of tastefullness from a porn festival.[^9]
[^8]: Interestingly, the reversal of this film technique was used to similarly stunning fashion with the Girl in The Red Coat in Schindler's List.
[^9]: Make no mistake, at this point all notions of a Tasteful Burlesque Show of innuendo and sex-positivity were gone. I was watching pornography. With friends. In a bar. And the sound production was terrible.
[^10] I am pro-GMO, and as such, reject the conflation of Naturalness and Beauty. If Michael Jordan shaves his armpits, so can you!
[^11]: Gone were my illusions of consent-positivty[^12] in this festival of pornographers. Frequent readers of my blog will suspect that it is here I began to be triggered.
[^12]: Although, it does raise interesting questions of consent. How would I have felt if the genders were reversed? (even ickier) If it happened over the course of a week and she just manipulated (was charming) him into having sex with her would I feel icky then? (no).  
[^13]: Like an Arby's commerical.
