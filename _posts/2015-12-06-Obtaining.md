There is a non-insignifigant part of me that wants to get into shape (*read attractive*) 
so that when an attractive girl looks at me, I can sneer at her. This is a somewhat
troubling state of affairs.

What if I enter into a relationship with a dreamboat? Just imagine that-- being in bed next to this gorgous human being. I've just woken up, and I prop myself up on an elbow to look over at her. Just then, she snuggles deeper into the blankets, a content smile on her lips (of course, I entertain the conceit that she is dreaming of me). I reach down and gently put my hand above her navel, and I can feel the baby, our baby, kick softly as it turns. It occurs to me that I've never been happier. A part of me is in disbelief that this magnificent human being has chosen me, and I can't help but smile.


She wouldn't have even looked at me when I was fat.


Fucking bitch.
