<h1 id='death'>Death?</h1>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I am so, so sorry!.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is what Tim Keller wanted to say. In fact, he was straining desperately to speak at all. Normally Tim was a very verbose man; in fact, on several occasions he&#8217;d witnessed a conversational partner&#8217;s eyes glaze over. At this point in time, Tim could not voice his thoughts. This was because Tim Mapleton was drowning and his mouth was full of water.</p>

<p>The shame he felt at the thought of having to be rescued was quickly being replaced by full on panic as his head bobbed up and down in the gentle waves. It was an unfortunate turn of events, until this point it had been a very ordinary, but pleasant vacation. The break from work had been welcome, and he had just begun to relax into the trip. A harmless little swim to shed some nervous energy, to just float in the lake and bathe in the sun&#8217;s rays. He could still see his wife and son, splashing in the shallows. His son&#8217;s giggle carried easily over the flat surface of the lake and Tim smiled, despite himself.</p>

<p>He was pulled under again, but found he didn&#8217;t have the strength to kick back up. His felt like he was pulling himself through molasses, a sticky morass that clung to him, dragged and clutched, pulling him down, down.</p>

<p>This would tear them apart, he thought in a brief moment of lucidity. He could see his son splashing around in those vivid red water wings, while his wife laughed and smiled, her golden hair spinning the sunlight into a halo around her head. At the time, those waterwings had seemed like a harmless, vaguely unmanly, indulgence of the fears of childhood. Now, they seemed like a really good fucking idea.</p>

<p>He resurfaced, gasping for breathe. His mouth barely breaching the surface as it sucked and gasped at the air. Recalling a news program he had watched about what to do in the event of drowning, Tim kicked his shoes off.</p>

<p>It had been hard for Tim to accept that he was drowning. Even now, he hardly exhibited the symptoms of a drowning man. No cries for help. No dramatic shouts, or splashing. He wasn&#8217;t waving his arms wildly in the air. In fact, Tim seemed altogether too calm for a man drowning. But far from possessing a quiet dignity about the whole thing, this was because Tim had by now inhaled far too much of the waters of Lake Michigan, and was rather tired.</p>

<p>Tim clawed at the water, his body fully in the thrall of the brutal, unrelenting motions of panic. With a last burst of strength he forced his head above water. His son, his wife, splashing happily in the shallows. The young lifeguard perched in his tower, leaning down to talk to a young woman in a bikini. Turning his head, he caught Tim&#8217;s eyes. The last thing Tim saw before he went down for the last time was the whites of those eyes.</p>

<p>He held his breath. He hadn&#8217;t managed to get much air, and he could feel the clastrophoic pressure of having no air in your lungs, the body screaming, begging for oxygen. It pushed in on him from all sides, from inside of him. He opened his mouth, gagging at the effort require not to breath in.</p>

<p>Tim looked upwards, he could see the surface, just above his slowly flailing hands. It had the placid dapple of a swimming pool being stirred gently in a summer breeze.</p>

<p>Tim breathed out, and then he breathed in. The water rushed in over his eyes, filling his mouth, his nostrils. It was forcing its way into him, pushing into his body. He tried to push, to push it out, but it kept rushing back in, flooding into his spasming lungs.</p>

<p>Tim had recently watched a nature documentary centered around a pack of Alaskan wolves. One scene in particular had always stuck with him. It was near the end of a chase, the pack had seperated a young deer from its mother and had been herding it, nipping its heels to drive it into exhaustion. The deer was tired of running, you could see it in the whites of its eyes, the way it stumbled and staggered onwards. The wolves had dispensed with pretense and begun to eat it. Tearing steaming chunks out of the deer as it ran and stumbled. The barbarity had shocked Tim at the time, but what had really stuck with him was when, near the end of its run it had just layed down. It was so calm. It had this quiet dignity as it lay there. It didn&#8217;t fight, didn&#8217;t struggle as the wolves ate it alive, picking flesh off its still breathing form. That quiet acceptance had terrified Tim.</p>

<p>Tim had stopped struggling now. His lungs still seized, spasming around the fluid rushing to fill them, but he was strangely distant from it. He began to sink, his clothes weighed down by the water. There was a calmness that gripped Tim, and as he watched the last of the air bubble up away from him, he considered that it was probably shock.</p>

<p>The last thing Tim felt before he blacked out was a strong hand gripping his hair.</p>

<p>-&gt;*&lt;-</p>

<p>A big face, with an angry pimple on its nose. A sparse forest of hairs on the upper lip, and a thin roapy chain of saliva between the upper and lower lip. All of this was swooping down towards Tim in an inevitable slow motion. This was the first thing he saw when he came to.</p>

<p>The second thing Tim saw was the large crowd of people clustering around him, everone&#8217;s eyes wide, staring directly at him. Tim became more and more aware of the cold, wet feeling of his swim trucks clinging to his thighs. He imagined what he must look like: a middle aged man, muffin topping over his slightly too tight shorts, skinny pale legs lying limply in the sand. All of this caused a deep sense of embarrassment to fall over him.</p>

<p>All at once, Tim wished he was back out in the ocean. He tried to say, &#8220;No! Please! I&#8217;m so sorry, I didn&#8217;t mean to be an inconvenience. Really, I&#8217;m fine.&#8221; but his throat had ceased to work. In that moment, Tim truly wanted to die. Instead, he just closed his eyes and did his best to shut out the world.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>Tim had been strapped into a stretched and bundled into an ambulance. They hadn&#8217;t shut the doors, and he could hear voices directly outside. &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand it,&#8221; the lifeguard was saying to an EMT, &#8220;maybe I just wasn&#8217;t fast enough&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did your best, okay? This isn&#8217;t anyone&#8217;s fault.&#8221; The EMT paused. &#8220;I just need to ask you, one last time: Did he ever show any signs of responsiveness?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey? Any sign at all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Maybe if I had been faster.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other EMT was talking to Tim&#8217;s wife. Tim peaked, allowing one eye to slowly nlid. He could make them out, standing right in front of the doors. They weren&#8217;t look at him. She was standing there, arms folded across her chest, face ashen.</p>

<p>&#8221;I&#8217;m sorry, Mrs. Keller, we just don&#8217;t know. The folks up at St. Mary&#8217;s will be able to tell you more.&#8221; The EMT put his hand on her shoulder. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to go now.&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded, eyes tight. She was making that face, that universal face of someone who doesn&#8217;t trust themselves to speak.</p>

<p><em>This has gone too far. Just sit up, and tell everyone you&#8217;re fine.</em> Tim thought.</p>

<p>But he might have to explain that he was fine, there was nothing wrong with him, and he had just been really embarrassed and had wanted to pretend he was anywhere but here. However, Tim decided he couldn&#8217;t look the EMT in the eye if that happened, so he kept his eyes closed.</p>

<p>-&gt;*&lt;-</p>

<p>&#8220;He just isn&#8217;t responding. We still don&#8217;t even know what&#8217;s wrong with him. Okay look,&#8221; The doctor turned his monitor around, bringing up two videos and gesturing at them with his pen. &#8220;These are two MRI&#8217;s. One is a healthy person, cogent and awake, the other is your husband.&#8221; The doctor looked up at Tim&#8217;s wife, &#8220;Can you tell which is which?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tim&#8217;s wife was fidgeting with a tissue, her face pinched. &#8220;Well, no. But I&#8217;m not a doctor!&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor leaned back in his chair and raised his hands up. &#8220;Trust me, no one can. We&#8217;re flying the best neurologist in the country here. He should be here tomorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ghost of a wince crept over Tim&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>The doctor stood up, and began to pace. &#8220;Mrs. Keller, Tim&#8217;s brain will actually respond to stimuli. If you speak to him, the speech centers of the brain light up, as if he is thinking of a response. He just can&#8217;t seem to translate that into control over his body. Yet his spine is just fine!&#8221; The doctor threw his hands in the air, fixing Tim&#8217;s wife with a pleading look. &#8220;You don&#8217;t understand how frustrating this is, Mrs. Keller. We think that this is the only way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said he is fine. You said he is in there. Why do you want to cut him open?&#8221; Tim&#8217;s wife started to cry. &#8220;Why won&#8217;t he wake up?&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor sat, not looking at her. Tim&#8217;s wife stood up, softly.</p>

<p>&#8221;I&#8217;m sorry. Do whatever you think is best, Doctor. Even if that means&#8230;&#8221;, she paused, dabbing at her eyes with the tissue. &#8220;Even if that means the surgery you described.&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor nodded. &#8221;I&#8217;m sorry, Mrs. Kelley. We&#8217;re doing the best we can, we really are.&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded once, slowly, before she left. The doctor followed her out.</p>

<p><em>This had gone on far too long. It is out of control.</em></p>

<p>He couldn&#8217;t even bear to think about how much money this was costing his insurance company.</p>

<p><em>I&#8217;ll just tell them I feel fine, and I would like to go home.</em></p>

<p>Tim walked himself through the scenario, imagining the hollow pronouncement&#8211;&#8220;Hey guys. Miracle! I feel fine now.&#8221;, the slight suspicion in his wife&#8217;s eyes, the knowing look the doctor would give him, that you-little-fucker-you&#8217;ve-been-fine-this-whole-time-and-we-flew-down-the-best-neurologist-in-the-country-who-do-you-think-you-are look.</p>

<p>No, that would be simply too much. It would be too much to face everyone now. Tim decided he would just have to wait it out.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sorry. I&#8217;m so sorry.</p>

<p>-&gt;***&lt;-</p>
