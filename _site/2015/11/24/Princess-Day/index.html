<p>Princess day was born out of my frustration with the courtship process. I found
that I was spending money, time and energy planning and executing first, second
and third dates for complete strangers. Unfortunately, the patriarchy wonâ€™t let
women plan and execute their own dates and this asymmetry had started to bother me.</p>

<p>Especially with the statistic fact that 50% of the people you meet are going to be
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics">shitheads</a>, this can all add up to heartbreak
and dissatisfaction. Thus, Princess Day was born of the simple realization that, instead
of treating these complete strangers as princesses to be pampered and feted, I should
be treating myself that way.</p>

<p>So, Princess Day is a date that I take myself, and any close friends who want to come, on.
Because, at the end of the day, you are the most important person, so let yourself know that.</p>
