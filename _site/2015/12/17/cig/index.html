  <h1 class="post-title">The Unexpected Social Utility of Cigarettes</h1>
  <time datetime="2015-12-17T00:00:00-07:00" class="post-date">17 Dec 2015</time>
  <p>I was watching a film recently and had an epiphany. There was a scene when the young protagonist, frustrated with his bandmates, leaves the studio and smokes a cigarette outside. He is quickly joined by Maggie Gyllenhal. However, there is a good 5-10 seconds of him just smoking a cigarette. I&#8217;m convinced the scene wouldn&#8217;t have worked without the cig. It would have been weird, he would have just been staring out into the middle distance, slightly peevishly.</p>

<p>My insight is thus: had such wonderful social and personal utility, apart from their addictive qualities. See a cute girl and want to chat her up without being weird? Ask for a light! Share a cig! Of course, this doesn&#8217;t work anymore because rational people don&#8217;t smoke&#8211; it is literally killing you. Eric.</p>

<p>Not only that, what could be more intimate than sharing a cig with someone after sex? There is something universal about that, a cognitive, rather than sensual, intimacy between two people sharing a cig in bed.</p>

<p>Want to step outside and just have a think? You&#8217;d look weird leaning against a wall, staring out like a space cadet. Why not smoke! People understand, they just see an addict getting zir&#8217;s fix, rather than a pervert just staring. This is especially necessary if you work next to a playground.</p>

<p>I can think of a dozen more uses for cig&#8217;s. Maybe that is why they are still around, and still being depicted in the media. In fact, most depictions of cig&#8217;s in media serve a purpose. Next time you watch a film or TV show, you&#8217;ll notice that most every cig serves a purpose. Even in the always subtle Mad Men, where everyone smokes, there are at least billion scenes where a smoking Doctor is examining a smoking pregnant woman&#8211; showing how shitty people were back then, I guess. More to the point, they are usually used more subtly to show weakness, addiction, stress. They can encourage intimacy or distance between two people, and they can evoke disgust.</p>

<p>But seriously, you should quit smoking, Eric.</p>
